        <h1>Yoga</h1>
        <p>Yoga is a group of physical, mental, and spiritual practices or disciplines that originated in ancient India, <br>aimed at controlling and stilling the mind, and recognizing the detached 'witness-consciousness' <br>as untouched by the activities of the mind and mundane suffering.</p>

        <h1>Benefits of Yoga</h1>
        <p>While there's scope for more rigorous studies on its health benefits, most studies suggest yoga is a safe and effective way to increase physical activity – especially strength, flexibility and balance.

            There's some evidence that regular yoga practice may be beneficial for people with high blood pressure, heart disease, aches and pains – including lower back pain – depression and stress.</p>

                <h2>Improves Flexibility</h2>
                <p>Improved flexibility is one of the first and most obvious benefits of yoga. During your first class, you probably won’t be able to touch your toes, never mind do a backbend. But if you stick with it, you’ll notice a gradual loosening, and eventually, seemingly impossible poses will become possible.</p>

            <div class="box-col">
                <h2> Builds Muscle</h2>
                <p>Strong muscles protect us from conditions like arthritis and back pain, and help prevent falls in elderly people. And when you build strength through yoga, you balance it with flexibility. If you just went to the gym and lifted weights, you might build strength at the expense of flexibility.</p>

                <h2>Protects Your Spine</h2>
                <p>If you’ve got a well-balanced asana practice with plenty of backbends, forward bends, and twists, you’ll help keep your disks supple. Long term flexibility is a known benefit of yoga, but one that remains especially relevant for spinal health.</p>
