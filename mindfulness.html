            <!--subtext explaining title-->
            <p>Mindfulness is the basic human ability to be fully present, aware of where we are and what we’re doing,
                <br>and not overly reactive or overwhelmed by what’s going on around us.

        <h1>Benefits of Mindfulness</h1>
        <p>The term "mindfulness" has been used to refer to a psychological state of awareness, the practices that
            promote this awareness, a mode of processing information and a character trait. To be consistent with most
            of the research reviewed in this article, we define mindfulness as a moment-to-moment awareness of one's
            experience without judgment. In this sense, mindfulness is a state and not a trait. While it might be
            promoted by certain practices or activities, such as meditation, it is not equivalent to or synonymous with
            them. - <a href="https://www.apa.org/monitor/2012/07-08/ce-corner" target="_blank">APA</a></p>

                <h2>Stress Reduction</h2>
                <p> Many studies show that practicing mindfulness reduces stress. In 2010, Hoffman et al. conducted a
                    meta-analysis of 39 studies that explored the use of mindfulness-based stress reduction and
                    mindfulness-based cognitive therapy. The researchers concluded that mindfulness-based therapy may be
                    useful in altering affective and cognitive processes that underlie multiple clinical issues.</p>

                <h2>Focus</h2>
                <p>Another study examined how mindfulness meditation affected participants' ability to focus attention
                    and suppress distracting information. The researchers compared a group of experienced mindfulness
                    meditators with a control group that had no meditation experience. They found that the meditation
                    group had significantly better performance on all measures of attention and had higher self-reported
                    mindfulness. Mindfulness meditation practice and self-reported mindfulness were correlated directly
                    with cognitive flexibility and attentional functioning (Moore and Malinowski, 2009).</p>

                <h2>Relationship Satisfaction</h2>
                <p>The ability to respond well to relationship stress and the skill in communicating one's emotions to a
                    partner. Empirical evidence suggests that mindfulness protects against the emotionally stressful
                    effects of relationship conflict (Barnes et al., 2007), is positively associated with the ability to
                    express oneself in various social situations (Dekeyser el al., 2008) and predicts relationship
                    satisfaction (Barnes et al., 2007; Wachs & Cordova, 2007).</p>
